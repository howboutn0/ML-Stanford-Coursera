# ML-Stanford-Coursera
My solutions to the online ML course by Andrew Ng. Each algorithm implemented here was done in matlab. 
- ex1: Implement Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
- ex2: Implement Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent
- ex3: Implement multi-class classifier to recognize hand-written digits
- ex4: Implement vanilla multi-layer-perceptron to recognize hand-written digits
